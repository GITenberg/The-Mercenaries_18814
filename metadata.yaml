description: Should a nation''s political climate guide its scientific agenda, or
  should research exist in a separate realm that''s unaffected by these types of considerations?
  That''s the question at the heart of ""The Mercenaries,"" a thought-provoking science
  fiction tale from H. Beam Piper. In a world divided by political schisms, one group
  of independent scientists fights to preserve its integrity at all costs.
